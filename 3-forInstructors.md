# Instructor information

Course requirements:
1. All courses must have hands-on exercises for the attendees.
1. Whenever possible, courses must show examples on Compute Canada's national systems. For example, when
  demonstrating a workflow in a programming language, show the entire process on
  [Cedar](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar) or
  [Graham](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Graham), not just inside the IDE on your laptop.
  - at the minimum, show some examples on clusters
  - if applicable to your course, show scaling up to large problem sizes and many cores/nodes
  - work with WestGrid to debug your cluster workflow

Please send us:
1. your course syllabus early on -- you can always iterate on it later, and
1. any information you would like to pass to the attendees: what software they need to
   install on their laptop, prerequisites for this course, the level of difficulty (beginner /
   intermediate / expert)

Please check out the online description of your course in the program and let us know if you want to add
or change anything.
