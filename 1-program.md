## Action items

**Garth:**
* confirm with Todd: planning to be in Vancouver for the entire summer school (flying back on Thursday
  night)
* now looking into either using a splitter to get the video signal, or recording with a camera; OBS is no
  longer an option
* will talk to his contacts in AV support at UBC Vancouver about borrowing the equipment
* will make sure there is a proper LAN connection (not relying on wireless for broadcast)

**Alex:**
* ONGOING work with Mathworks

**Jamie:**
- Apr-06 Martin Krzywinski is still unsure, will try to answer soon (but not the design course)

**Roman:**
* Apr-03 Gino DiLabio: interested, but mostly likely will travel, will let us know in a couple of days
* Apr-03 waiting to hear from Ian Allison (PIMS) on someone from his team to teach Jupyter/Python; Ian
  himself will be in Europe; could be Patrick Walls?
