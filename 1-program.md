# 2018 notes

Alex Razoumov
- *Introduction to HPC* (full-day, could shorten)
- *Chapel* (full-day)
- *Scientific visualization with ParaView* (full-day, could shorten)

Wolfgang Richter (to be confirmed)
- a database workshop

Posssible other topics
- something on DH on CC hardware
  - tap Even Thornberry, the new GIS librarian at UBC
- genomics on CC hardware
  - GenAP portal? (better fit for CC audience?)
  - GSC?
  - using Galaxy on Cedar?
- HPC Python
- other high-level programming languages (MATLAB, Julia)
- hybrid programming with MPI+OpenMP
- GPU programming with CUDA and OpenACC
- Jupyter notebooks and scientific computing in Python
- CC cloud
- Hadoop, Spark, data science
- OpenMP, MPI (probably not since we'll have Chapel)

Here is what we would like to do differently this year:

1. have as much participation from analysts and the UBC ARC staff (teaching the courses),
1. have more stringent rules for faculty-delivered courses: must have hands-ons, must use our national systems, must send us a syllabus before a deadline in May (otherwise their class will be cancelled); the same should apply to any GSC presentations so that they donâ€™t end up promoting their own clusters,
1. find a way to clearly recognize and promote faculty who support the schools / present sessions.
