**Title**: Basics of scientific visualization with ParaView

Abstract: ParaView is an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization tool designed to run
on a variety of hardware from an individual laptop to large supercomputers. With ParaView users can
interactively visualize 2- and 3-dimensional data defined on structured, adaptive and unstructured meshes
or particles, animate these datasets in time, and manipulate them with a variety of filters. ParaView
supports both interactive (GUI) and scripted (including offscreen) visualization, and is an easy and fun
tool to learn.

This half-day introductory workshop will feature many interactive hands-on exercises, so attendees need
to bring a laptop (and perhaps a power cord for use throughout the day) and should have ParaView
installed (https://www.paraview.org/download) before the workshop. No prior visualization experience is
required. We will provide all sample data and codes for the exercises, and you can bring your dataset if
you want to visualize it with ParaView.

**Target audience**: anyone interested in 3D scientific visualization

**Course plan**:
- introduction to multidimensional visualization; tool comparison
- ParaView's GUI overview
- importing your data into ParaView
- importing data into ParaView
- building a visualization pipeline (working with plots and filters)
- basic animation

More advanced animation, scripting and remote visualization will be covered in a separate
[*Large-scale remote visualization with ParaView*]({{ site.baseurl}}/alex3.html) course in the afternoon.

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: Attendees should bring their laptops with the latest version of ParaView installed
from http://www.paraview.org/download. No prior visualization experience is required. We will provide
sample data and codes for many interactive hands-on exercises, and you can bring your dataset if you
would like to visualize it with ParaView.
