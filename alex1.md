**Title**: Parallel programming in Chapel

This course is a general introduction to the main concepts of the Chapel parallel programming
language. Chapel is a relatively new language for both shared- and distributed-memory programming, with
easy-to-use, high-level abstractions for both task and data parallelism that make it ideal for learning
parallel programming for a novice HPC user.

Chapel is incredibly intuitive, striving to merge the ease-of-use of Python and the performance of
traditional compiled languages such as C and Fortran. Parallel constructs that typically take tens of
lines of MPI code can expressed in only a few lines of Chapel code. Chapel is open source and can run on
any Unix-like operating system, with hardware support from a laptop to a large HPC system.

**Target audience**: general

**Course plan**:
- introduction to Chapel basic language features
- task parallelism (mostly on single node)
- data parallelism (both on single and across multiple nodes)

**Duration**: 6 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: None

**Setup**: Cedar reservation with 4 nodes * 3 cores/node per attendee.
