**Title**: MATLAB Parallel Computing Hands-On Workshop

During this hands-on workshop, MathWorks engineers will introduce you to parallel and distributed
computing in MATLAB with a focus on speeding up your application code and offloading compute. By working
through common scenarios and workflows using hands-on demos, you will gain an understanding of the
parallel constructs in MATLAB, their capabilities, and some of the common hurdles that you'll encounter
when using them. You'll also learn how to run your MATLAB code on Compute Canada resources.

You can download the course materials as a [ZIP file]({{ site.baseurl }}/PCT_Workshop_Content.zip).
