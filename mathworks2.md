**Title**: MATLAB Parallel Computing Hands-On Workshop

During this hands-on workshop, MathWorks engineers will introduce you to parallel and distributed
computing in MATLAB with a focus on speeding up your application code and offloading compute. By working
through common scenarios and workflows using hands-on demos, you will gain an understanding of the
parallel constructs in MATLAB, their capabilities, and some of the common hurdles that you'll encounter
when using them. You'll also learn how to run your MATLAB code on Compute Canada resources.

**Target audience**: anyone interested learning more about MATLAB

**Course plan**:

- Speeding up programs with parallel computing
- Offloading computations and cluster computing
- Working with large data sets
- GPU Computing
- Running MATLAB on Compute Canada Cedar/Graham resources

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: intermediate

**Prerequisites**: 

**Setup**:
- *Cluster reservation*: 4 cores per participant
