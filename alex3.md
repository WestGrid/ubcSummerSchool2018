**Title**: Large-scale remote visualization with ParaView

Abstract: ParaView is an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization tool designed to run
on a variety of hardware from an individual laptop to large supercomputers. With ParaView users can
interactively visualize 2- and 3-dimensional data defined on structured, adaptive and unstructured meshes
or particles, animate these datasets in time, and manipulate them with a variety of filters. ParaView
supports both interactive (GUI) and scripted (including offscreen) visualization, and is an easy and fun
tool to learn.

**Target audience**: anyone interested in 3D scientific visualization

**Course plan**:
- more on animation
- scripting
- remote and parallel visualization

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: intermediate

**Prerequisites**: Some basic knowledge of ParaView materials covered in the
[introductory visualization course]({{ site.baseurl }}/alex1.html) in the morning. Attendees should bring
their laptops with the latest version of ParaView installed from http://www.paraview.org/download. No
prior visualization experience is required. We will provide sample data and codes for many interactive
hands-on exercises, and you can bring your dataset if you would like to visualize it with ParaView.
