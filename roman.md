**Instructor**: Roman Baranowski (UBC)

**RDM speaker**: Megan Meredith-Lobay

**Title**: Introduction to HPC

An introduction to high-performance computing for those without any HPC experience.

**Target audience**: general

**Course plan**:
- introduction to Compute Canada systems; cluster hardware overview
- basic knowledge and tools necessary to work with the cluster: how to log in, transfer files, write make
  files, compile codes, submit jobs, etc.
- quick overview of different parallel programming models: OpenMP, MPI, Chapel
- debugging
- profiling and optimization
- best practices
- research data management in 30 mins (Megan)
  - overview of Globus, ownCloud/Nextcloud, and using these for file sharing and publishing
  - possible: tools for creating RDM plans, file naming, sharing, privacy/security issues
  - not likely: using these tools from the command line
- overview of what is going to be presented in the other sessions

**Duration**: 6 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of Linux command line

- *Cluster space*:
- *Cluster software*:
- *Laptop software*:

<!-- Alex for Megan's part: That’s great! Anything I can do to help with developing the materials for this -->
<!-- course, please let me know. Especially using Globus and cloud sharing to transfer data to/from CC -->
<!-- systems. -->

<!-- It would be nice to see how to share and how to publish files with both Globus and the cloud service. In -->
<!-- Globus they always mention publishing, and it’s a separate service, but I’ve been told we added it -->
<!-- recently to CC’s Globus. John might know the details, and we can always discuss it in the next Team HSS -->
<!-- meeting, and also talk about the status of ownCloud “nationalization”. Certainly we don’t want to teach -->
<!-- services that we don’t offer, but I am pretty sure offering Globus publishing is in the pipeline. Jason -->
<!-- Hlady from USask might know the details, and I also ask around. -->

<!-- Anything you could adapt from the DHSI course — but only if it applies to all researchers — could also be -->
<!-- useful in the WestGrid summer school course. Maybe, best practices for security, or creating RDM plans -->
<!-- without HSS details. -->

<!-- Using Globus and cloud file services from the command line could also be useful, and I can research into -->
<!-- these, but again this is optional. -->
