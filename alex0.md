**Title**: Parallel programming in Chapel

This is a general introduction to the main concepts of the Chapel parallel programming language. Chapel
is a relatively new language for both shared- and distributed-memory programming, with easy-to-use,
high-level abstractions that make it ideal for learning parallel programming for a novice HPC user.

**Target audience**: general

**Course plan**:
- introduction to Chapel basic language features
- task parallelism (mostly on single node)
- data parallelism (both on single and multiple nodes)

**Duration**: 6 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: None
