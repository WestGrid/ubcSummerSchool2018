Morning sessions will be 9:00am-12:00pm. Afternoon sessions will be 1:00pm-4:00pm. All sessions will take
place in the UBC Geography Building (<a href="http://bit.ly/2GXwB71" target="_blank">see the exact
location</a>), in rooms GEOG 200, GEOG 101 and GEOG 147 (also an overflow room).

These pages will continue to be updated as details are confirmed for room assignments, session times and
detailed course information.

**Important**: All attendees must bring their laptops and power cords (if your battery does not last all
day). Don't forget to check details and prerequisites for each course, including software requirements
for your laptop under **Setup** > *Laptop software*. Please install the required software before coming
to class.

Before the start of the summer school **all eligible attendees must obtain**:

1. Their Compute Canada acounts. You can find detailed instructions
   [here](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account). Please
   note that the same Compute Canada account will let you log in to both Cedar and Graham clusters.
  - if you are not eligible to apply for a Compute Canada account (for non-academic attendees), we will
    provide a guest account for you
2. Their Eduroam accounts through their home institutions. You will need online access to complete the
   hands-on exercises, log in to remote systems, view documentation, etc., so please make sure you can
   sign in to Eduroam. If not sure how to obtain it, please contact the local IT department at your
   institution.
